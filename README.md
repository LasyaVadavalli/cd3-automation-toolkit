## Introduction

CD3 stands for **C**loud **D**eployment **D**esign **D**eliverable. 

The CD3 Automation toolkit has been developed to help in automating the OCI resource object management. 

It reads input data in the form of CD3 Excel sheets and generates the terraform files instead of handling the task through the OCI console manually. The toolkit also reverse-engineers the components in OCI back to the Excel sheet and Terraform configuration. This generated Terraform code can be used by the OCI Resource Manager or leveraged by the organisationsâ€™ CI/CD processes.

> To ease the execution of toolkit, we have provided the steps to build an image which encloses the code base and its package dependencies. Follow the steps provided below to clone the repo and build the image.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

* Git
* Any docker cli compatible platform such as Docker or Rancher.
* OCI Tenancy Access Requirement 
    + Appropriate IAM policies must be in place for each of the resources that the user may try to create.

The minimum requirement to get started is read permissions on the tenancy.

### To clone the repo

1. Open your terminal and change the directory to the one where you want to download the git repo.
2. Run the git clone command:
       
        git clone https://github.com/oracle-devrel/cd3-automation-toolkit
3. Once the cloning command completes successfully, the repo will replicate to the local directory. 

### To build an image

1. Change directory to cd3-automation-toolkit(i.e. the cloned repo in your local).
2. Run `docker build -t cd3toolkit:${image_tag} -f Dockerfile --pull --no-cache`

    > **Note** : _${image_tag} should be replaced with suitable tag as per your requirements/standards._

### To save the image (Optional)

    docker save cd3toolkit:${image_tag} | gzip > cd3toolkit_${image_tag}.tar.gz

### To run the CD3 container and exec into it

* Run `docker run -it -d -v <path_in_local_system_where_the_files_must_be_generated>:/cd3user/tenancies <image_name>:<image_tag>`
* Run `docker ps`
* Run `docker exec -it <container_id> bash`

Follow the toolkit docs i.e. from the section _Configuring the Docker Container to connect to OCI Tenancy_ in 
[CD3 Automation Tookit - End To End Process Documentation](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/cd3-automation-toolkit/blob/develop/cd3_automation_toolkit/documentation/user_guide/01%20CD3%20Automation%20Toolkit%20-%20End%20to%20End%20Process.pdf). Please download the document from Github.

* The _CD3 Quick Start template_ can be found at [CD3 CIS Template](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/cd3-automation-toolkit/blob/develop/cd3_automation_toolkit/example/CD3-CIS-template.xlsx)
* The _CD3 Sample Excel templates_ can be found at [Excel Templates](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/cd3-automation-toolkit/tree/develop/cd3_automation_toolkit/example)

> **Note:** _The above steps have been tested on Windows (Git Bash) and macOS._
