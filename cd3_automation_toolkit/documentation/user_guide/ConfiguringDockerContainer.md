## Configuring the Docker Container to connect to OCI Tenancy

Follow the below steps to configure the docker container to connect to a tenancy:
> ***Repeat this process for every new customer. Same docker container can be connected to multiple OCI tenancies.***

Commands to execute inside the container:
| Steps | Command |
| ----- | ------- |
| Change Directory to that ofuser-scripts | ```cd /cd3user/oci_tools/cd3_automation_toolkit/user-scripts/``` |
| **API PEM keys:** If the key pair does not exist,create them using the script. | ```python /cd3user/oci_tools/cd3_automation_toolkit/user-scripts/createAPIKey.py``` |
| Upload the Public key to **"APIkeys"** under user settings inOCI Console. | Pre-requisite to use the complete functionality of the Automation Toolkit is to have the user as an administrator to the tenancy. <br><br>**Steps:**</br><ul><li>Open the Console, and sign in as the user.</li><li>View the details for the user who will be calling the API with the key pair.</li><li>Open the Profile menu (User menu icon) and click User Settings.</li><li>Click Add Public Key.</li><li>Paste the contents of the PEM public key in the dialog box and click Add.</li></ul>
| Enter the details to **tenancyconfig.properties** file | **tenancyconfig.properties**<br><br>[Default]<br>#Mandatory Fields<br>#Friendly name for the Customer Tenancy eg: gctenancy;<br>#The generated .auto.tfvars will be prefixed with this customer name<br>customer_name=<br>tenancy_ocid=<br>fingerprint=<br>user_ocid=<br>#Path of API Private Key (PEM Key) File; If the PEM keys were generated by running createAPI.py,leave this field empty.<br>#Defaults to /cd3user/tenancies/keys/oci_api_private.pem when left empty.<br>key_path=<br>#Region ; defaults to us-ashburn-1 when left empty.<br>region=<br>#Optional Fields<br>#SSH Key to launched instances<br>ssh_public_key= |
| Initialise your environment touse the Automation Toolkit | ```python /cd3user/oci_tools/cd3_automation_toolkit/user-scripts/createTenancyConfig.py tenancyconfig.properties```<br><br>***If the API Keys were generated and added to the OCI console using the previous steps, it might take a couple of seconds to reflect. Thus, running the above command immediately might result in Authentication Errors.<br><br>In such cases, please retry after a minute.*** |

**Files created on successfully completing the above steps -**
1. A customer specific Config file
2. Customer specific setUpOCI.properties file
3. Region based directories along with Variables File, Provider File, Root and Sub modules
4. Public and Private Key Pairs
5. cmds.log file that contains a copy of the Commands to execute section of the console output
6. A documentation directory with two sub directories containing .pdf and .md files providing instructions on how to use the toolkit and edit the .auto.tfvars

Description of the Generated files:
| Files Generated | At File Path | Comment/Purpose |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Config File | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/<customer_name>_config``` | Customer specificConfig file isrequired for OCI APIcalls. |
| setUpOCI.properties | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/<customer_name>_setUpOCI.properties``` | Customer Specificproperties files willbe created. |
| Region baseddirectories | ```/rcd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/terraform_files``` | Tenancy'ssubscribed regionsbased directories forthe generation andsegregation ofterraform files. |
| Variables File,Provider File, Rootand Sub modules | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/terraform_files/<region>``` | Required forterraform to work. |
| Public and PrivateKey Pairs | Copied from ```/cd3user/tenancies/keys/```<br>to<br>```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/``` | API Keys that werepreviouslygenerated aremoved to customerspecific out directorylocations for easyaccess. |
| A log file with thecommands toexecute | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/cmds.log``` | This file contains acopy of the Commands toexecute section of the console output. |
| Documentation folder | ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/documentation/user_guide/``` ```/cd3user/tenancies/<customer_name>/documentation/terraform/``` | These folderscontain the PDF and.md files with instructions on howto use the toolkit andedit the .auto.tfvars. |
